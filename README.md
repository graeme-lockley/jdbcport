# jdbcport

A (very) simple ORM to support a hexagonal architecture style using a simple abstraction of database-table-row with
associated CRUD operations.

Using things project as a prototype to create a ci-pipeline script to assist a CI server.  I have the view that the individual CI 
tasks should be included in the projects VCS so taht, as the project evolves, the project knows how to build itself.
